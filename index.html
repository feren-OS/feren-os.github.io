      <p class="text-off-black mt-8">
        With Feren OS, you get a desktop that is easy to initially set up, and then stays out of your way afterwards, with features users would expect such as an applications menu, task manager, and system tray, alongside other features.
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-black mt-8">
        Once you've set up Feren OS, you can immediately get started with common daily tasks, and use Store to get applications you're missing.

      <p class="text-off-black mt-8">
        From office software, to internet browsers, to games, to media playback, and more, Feren OS comes with a whole variety of applications available in its, and our upstreams', repositories, all available from the Store and Web Browser Manager to download and install.
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-black mt-8">
        Furthermore, with Feren OS's lightweight resources usage, you can enjoy multitasking and running more applications at once, and with Feren OS you can update the applications you got from the Store alongside your system, rather than needing to go through multiple application update utilities for your installed applications.
