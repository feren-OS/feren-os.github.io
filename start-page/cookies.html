            For the Feren OS Start Page to work properly, this website uses cookies to store the following information offline:
            <div class="extraspacing">
                <div class="bulletpoints">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>• The search engine you last picked (lastengine) - This is used to remember your last picked Search Engine and choose it whenever the page loads, automatically.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>• Your custom background image (userbg) - This is used to remember your custom Start Page background image URL so that the custom background is applied whenever you load the Start Page.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>• Vivaldi First Run Status (Feren OS) (vivaldifirstrun) - This is used to make sure that Vivaldi shows you the Feren OS 'Welcome to Vivaldi' page on the First Run, and not to show it in future runs. It will not cause the page to redirect on the first run if cookie creation is blocked.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>• Tile *'s Target URL (tile*currenturl) - This is used to save the URL that you want said tile to direct your browser to on interaction with the tile.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>• Tile *'s Image URL (tile*currentimage) - This is used to save the URL of the image that you want said tile to use.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>• 12-hour clock? (12hrclock) - This is used to save your clock preference (24hr/12hr toggle).</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>• Last Configurations Migration (lastconfigmigration) - Used to check if some cookie settings have to be migrated or not to new values in the case of major Start Page changes.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>• cookieconsent_status - A cookie from the 'Cookie Consent' box you probably entered this page from to remember if you hit the 'OK' button or not on the prompt.</p></div>
                    <br>
                    <p>These cookies are stored completely offline, so no one gets to have a share of the cookies (except those with access to your machine locally), not even me.</p>
                </div>
